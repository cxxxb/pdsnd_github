### Project: Post my Bikeshare Python project on GitHub

### Description
My project, written in Python, provides the user with an interface allowing her/him to consult bikeshare usage statistics in three cities: Chicago, New York City and Washington. It allows the user to consult information, such as the most common route.

### Available bikeshare data
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year

### Files used
bikeshare.py contains the Python code.
Bikeshare usage data are in the files: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv
README.md contains these explanations you are now reading
.gitignore makes sure the (long) data files (chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv) are not shared on GitHub

### Credits
I did the original bikeshare project as well as its posting on GitHub as part of the Udacity "Programming for Data Science" nanodegree course: https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104
